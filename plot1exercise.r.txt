When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


#get the current working directory 
 getwd()
#[1] "C:/Users/Krishna/Documents/R/R EXDA CS1"
#find the files in the directory to check data exists.
 list.files()
#[1] "ExdaPlot1.Rmd"                   "household_power_consumption.txt"
#load data file and tables
 data_file <- "./household_power_consumption.txt"
 data_table <- read.table(data_file, header=TRUE, sep=";", stringsAsFactors=FALSE, dec=".")
 
#We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the #data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates. 
subSetData <- data_table[data_table$Date %in% c("1/2/2007","2/2/2007") ,]
summary(subSetData)

#Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
#choose the data
globalActivePower <- as.numeric(subSetData$Global_active_power)
#set the graphics device to png
png("plot1.png", width=480, height=480)
#plot
hist(globalActivePower, col="red", main="Global Active Power", xlab="Global Active Power (kilowatts)")
#switch of the graph device.
